MetaverseCore
=============

"kernel" example of a 3d virtual world built on processing.  

Metaverse Core is my attempt to fill the current void of a "kernel' a-la-Torvalds in the virtual world, 
for running user-defined virtul world environments.  I have writeen this personal version of Metaverse Core
to be a cool place for musicians and creative people to hang out and play with the given control features.  
One can make songs and mix them in with the room's audio or just keepo them local.  

There are other such efforts, such as Sunny's world which is a good bit further along than Metaverse Core
though hit lacks the flexibility and creative expression capabilities of Metaverse Core.  That's because 
programers can create with Metaverse Core.  They can make an operating system for a computer based on 
3DVW immersion, or maybe a chatroom with our selves scanned with 3D cameras.  

There are many thoughts that go along with Metaverse Core that define what it hopes to become, though it's
fair to say that any decent "real programmer (TM)" unlike me as scripter can grok what i did well enough to
reode it properly at least once, to create a clean core for people to work with.  maybe it should be a library.  

There is so much to write that I must stop for now and try to recall the better thoughts later.  enjoy.
